Assignment from AoD. Code-mon.
Final project consisted of Gui written in Java, a lexx/yacc parser, a Binary file created using C, and is supposed to have Database functionality for saving battle data.

The program will not execute fully as it requires a dedicated server that my Professor was running during the length of the course.
