Code-mon
========

Assignment from AoD. Code-mon.
Final project consisted of Gui written in Java, a lexx/yacc parser, a Binary file created using C, and is supposed to have Database functionality for saving battle data.

The program will not execute fully as it requires a dedicated server that my Professor was running during the length of the course.

In directory 2750F13_A4:

src - contains .c, .java, .lexx, and .yacc files

include - contains the header files needed for communications with the server, and the jni to c integration.

install_Codemon.sh - is a bash script I wrote that is supposed to install the Codemon application, and remove all unnecessary files not needed after installation is complete. Unfortunately, I had some errors perfecting this script.

helpFile.txt - explains how to use the program (displayed in program when click the help menu option)

makefile - a make file
